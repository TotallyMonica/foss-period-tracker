# Simple Period Tracker
You don't tell strangers you're on your period, so why should companies know?

## Why Simple Period Tracker?
Simple Period Tracker was designed with one thing in mind: privacy. Your period stays _on your phone_. It doesn't go to the cloud at all. I can't see your period information, only you do. Period.
